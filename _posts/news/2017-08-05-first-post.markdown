<p>This is my first news post ever!!!</p>
<p>Here I will post about what I've been up to, and what I'm working on.</p>
<p>The website is still in under construction, so things will change, and stuff will get added.</p>
<p>Currently working to add a <a href="{{ '/codeshrine/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">CodeShrine</a> page, this will contain my proudest code, mostly to do with variadic templates (I love variadic templates)</p>
